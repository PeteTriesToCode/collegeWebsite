              classes are always energetic and engaging. His infectious
              excitement and love for education make every lesson a memorable
              adventure, inspiring students to dive deep into their studies with
              enthusiasm and joy.

            <h3>Dr Star</h3>
            <p>
              Introducing Dr. Star Patrick, a laidback and easygoing lecturer
              known for his relaxed teaching style. However, don't let his calm
              demeanor fool you — Dr. Star has a surprising tendency to get
              really angry when provoked. Despite this, his unique approach to
              education and his ability to connect with students make his
              classes both unpredictable and memorable.
              <strong>Just DON'T make him angry.</strong>

              Introducing Fish Edwardson, an exceptionally strict lecturer known
              for his no-nonsense approach to teaching. Joking around is not an
              option in his classes, as he maintains a serious and disciplined
              atmosphere at all times. With a focus on rigor and precision, Fish
              Edwardson ensures that his students are always on their toes and
              fully engaged in their studies. <br /><strong

              Introducing Mr. Buzz Kill, a renowned professor with a mysterious
              past. Rumored to have been an assassin before fleeing his
              homeland, Mr. Buzz Kill now dedicates himself to academia. He is
              known for his complete lack of emotion—neither happiness nor anger
              ever cross his face. His stoic demeanor and enigmatic background
              captivate students, making his classes both intriguing and
              profoundly educational. <br /><strong
                >Rumor has it that students that fail his class, never see the
                light of day ever again.</strong
